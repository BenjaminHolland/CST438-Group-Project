### Deliverable 

We will create a website that allows users to find pick up games for sports in parks in their area. Users will be able to see local games happening in their area via an embedded map and form teams and plan games with other users with a built in chat room. When a users’ team wins a game in a park they upload the winner of the match to the website and their team logo is displayed over the park on the map, allowing other teams to fight to contest the park. Additionally, the website will keep stats for individual players and teams such as wins, losses, and a friends list.

### Motivation

It is difficult to find enough people to start a pickup game  at a local park ,whether an individual player is looking or a group. Additionally, a team of players cannot find an opponent team unless they join a local league and they have no way to compare their team to others. Our app makes it easy for a player to quickly find a team to play their favorite sport with and enjoy a competitive environment to rank their team against other local players.

### Technologies and Approach

Front end: Angular
We will use the AngularJS framework to develop our websites user interface and provide real time changes to the interface. We will also make server calls from the interface to pull in data and update components in real time based on the data.

Back end: Node JS
Node Js will help us create a server to take in requests from the front end and exchange data between it and the database. The server will also have our TCP sockets to implement the chat room.
Socket.io

Socket.io will be used as an server to provide real time updates in our chat room between all clients and the server. The sockets will carry messages between clients and server.
Database: MongoDB
Mongo will be our database to store map information such as coordinates of parks, team owned locations, and locations of all map markers. The database will also store all user info such as login info, teams, friends, and stats. Our server will exchange database information between the client and database. Mongodb stores data as JSON which makes it easily passable through HTTP messages.
Map
We will use Google Maps API to display the map on the front end and easily display markers and images on the map

### Dependencies and Risks

Our app relies on a connection to the Google Maps API to display the map and its data which is the majority of the front end. If the API fails then users will not be able to find matches based on the map. The app relies on the Node JS server being up to interact with the database and to use socket.io to connect with other users in the chat feature. Our app relies on users giving location services permissions to the web page so that the user’s town can be displayed on the map accurately. To deploy our app we rely on Heroku to setup the web page.

### Milestones

### Milestone 1
By milestone 1 the core functionality of our app will be complete. The core functionality is displaying a google map on the client web page. The map will show locations of local parks with map markers. There will be a search bar for the user to search for a specific location in their area for a game. The user can click on any marker and select to join an existing game at the park or create and schedule a new game at the park. Our database will be up and store information about the games at each park such as the players, time, and teams. The client will be able to contact the server via HTTP to update and pull information from the database. At this milestone we will be focusing more on functionality than appearance so the web page will not be styled.

### Milestone 2
By milestone 2 we will implement additional features that provide ease of access and social features to the app. We will implement the chat room so users who are in the same area can chat with each other to plan games at local parks. We will implement the teams features so that users can form teams with each other and schedule games with other teams in the area. We will also introduce the team competition feature where teams can fight over a park to have their logo displayed on the map.

### Milestone 3
For milestone 2 we will improve the style and appearance of the web page to make it more appealing and easier to use. If time permits we will introduce a ranking system for teams by ranking teams based off of wins and losses and provide leaderboards for teams in the users area. We will also work on fixing bugs introduced in the first two milestones and testing the app for weaknesses.
